Konfigator utility can search both the Linux kernel config macro definitions
and the descriptions in 'Kconfig' files under the default path
'/usr/src/linux', or under any other path specified.

(The kernel 'menuconfig' utility can currently search only the kernel config
macro definitions, but not the descriptions.)


System requirements:  /usr/bin/python version 2.7+


Installation instructions:

# cp -i ./konfigator.py /usr/bin/


Command line:

usage: konfigator.py [-h] [-k path] -s string [--version]

optional arguments:
  --help                show this help message and exit
  -k path, --kernel path
                        path to the Linux kernel source tree to search
                        (default: /usr/src/linux/)
  -s [string [string ...]], --search [string [string ...]]
                        terms to search for in the config tokens and
                        descriptions, sentences can be in quotes, only entries
                        matching ALL terms will be returned


Example usage:

$ konfigator.py -s bluetooth usb

/usr/src/linux/drivers/bluetooth/Kconfig
5:  config BT_HCIBTUSB
9:    Bluetooth HCI USB driver.
10:    This driver is required if you want to use Bluetooth devices with
11:    USB interface.
12:    
13:    Say Y here to compile support for Bluetooth USB devices into the
14:    kernel or say M to compile it as module (btusb).
15:    


/usr/src/linux/drivers/bluetooth/Kconfig
49:  config BT_HCIUART_BCSP
54:    BCSP (BlueCore Serial Protocol) is serial protocol for communication 
55:    between Bluetooth device and host. This protocol is required for non
56:    USB Bluetooth devices based on CSR BlueCore chip, including PCMCIA and
57:    CF cards.
58:    
59:    Say Y here to compile support for HCI BCSP protocol.
60:    


/usr/src/linux/drivers/bluetooth/Kconfig
84:  config BT_HCIBCM203X
89:    Bluetooth HCI BCM203x USB driver.
90:    This driver provides the firmware loading mechanism for the Broadcom
91:    Blutonium based devices.
92:    
93:    Say Y here to compile support for HCI BCM203x devices into the
94:    kernel or say M to compile it as module (bcm203x).
95:    


/usr/src/linux/drivers/bluetooth/Kconfig
96:  config BT_HCIBPA10X
100:    Bluetooth HCI BPA10x USB driver.
101:    This driver provides support for the Digianswer BPA 100/105 Bluetooth
102:    sniffer devices.
103:    
104:    Say Y here to compile support for HCI BPA10x devices into the
105:    kernel or say M to compile it as module (bpa10x).
106:    


/usr/src/linux/drivers/bluetooth/Kconfig
107:  config BT_HCIBFUSB
112:    Bluetooth HCI BlueFRITZ! USB driver.
113:    This driver provides support for Bluetooth USB devices with AVM
114:    interface:
117:    Say Y here to compile support for HCI BFUSB devices into the
118:    kernel or say M to compile it as module (bfusb).
119:    


/usr/src/linux/drivers/hid/Kconfig
7:  config HID
12:    A human interface device (HID) is a type of computer device that
13:    interacts directly with and takes input from humans. The term "HID"
14:    most commonly used to refer to the USB-HID specification, but other
15:    devices (such as, but not strictly limited to, Bluetooth) are
16:    designed using HID specification (this involves certain keyboards,
17:    mice, tablets, etc). This option adds the HID bus to the kernel,
18:    together with generic HID layer code. The HID devices are added and
19:    removed from the HID bus by the transport-layer drivers, such as
20:    usbhid (USB_HID) and hidp (BT_HIDP).
21:    
22:    For docs and specs, see http://www.usb.org/developers/hidpage/
23:    
24:    If unsure, say Y.
25:    


/usr/src/linux/drivers/usb/serial/Kconfig
59:  config USB_SERIAL_AIRCABLE
62:    Say Y here if you want to use USB AIRcable Bluetooth Dongle.
63:    
64:    To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
65:    will be called aircable.
66:
